sabre/uri is a lightweight library that provides several functions for working with U\+R\+Is, staying true to the rules of \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986/}{\tt R\+F\+C3986}.

Partially inspired by \href{http://nodejs.org/api/url.html}{\tt Node.\+js U\+RL library}, and created to solve real problems in P\+HP applications. 100\% unitested and many tests are based on examples from R\+F\+C3986.

The library provides the following functions\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily resolve} to resolve relative urls.
\item {\ttfamily normalize} to aid in comparing urls.
\item {\ttfamily parse}, which works like P\+HP\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php}{\tt parse\+\_\+url}.
\item {\ttfamily build} to do the exact opposite of {\ttfamily parse}.
\item {\ttfamily split} to easily get the \textquotesingle{}dirname\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}basename\textquotesingle{} of a U\+RL without all the problems those two functions have.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
