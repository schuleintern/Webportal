\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{3.\+2.\+0-\/alpha1 (2016-\/05-\/09) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Database changes for Cal\+D\+AV. If you are using the Cal\+D\+AV P\+DO backends, you must migrate. Run {\ttfamily ./bin/migrateto32.php} for more info.
\item Support for Web\+D\+AV Resource Sharing, an upcoming standard.
\item Added support for sharing in the Cal\+D\+AV P\+DO backend! Users can now invite others to their calendar and give them read/read-\/write access!
\item \#397\+: Support for P\+S\+R-\/3. You can now log exceptions with your favourite psr3-\/compatible logging tool.
\item \#825\+: Actual proper, tested support for Postgre\+S\+QL. We require version 9.\+5.
\item Removed database migration script for sabre/dav 1.\+7. To update from that version you now first need to update to sabre/dav 3.\+1.
\item Removed deprecated function\+: {\ttfamily Sabre\textbackslash{}D\+AV\textbackslash{}Auth\textbackslash{}Plugin\+::get\+Current\+User()}.
\item \#774\+: Fixes for getting free disk space on Windows.
\item \#803\+: Major changes in the sharing A\+PI. If you were using an old sabre/dav sharing api, head to the website for more detailed migration notes.
\item \#657\+: Support for optional auth using {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}unauthorized} and {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}all} privileges. This allows you to assign a privilege to a resource, allowing non-\/authenticated users to access it. For instance, this could allow you to create a public read-\/only collection.
\item \#812 \#814\+: I\+C\+S/\+V\+CF exporter now includes a more useful filename in its {\ttfamily Content-\/\+Disposition} header. ().
\item \#801\+: BC break\+: If you were using the {\ttfamily Href} object before, it\textquotesingle{}s behavior now changed a bit, and {\ttfamily Local\+Href} was added to replace the old, default behavior of {\ttfamily Href}. See the migration doc for more info.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Sabre\textbackslash{}D\+A\+V\+A\+CL\textbackslash{}Plugin\+::\$allow\+Access\+To\+Nodes\+Without\+A\+CL} setting. Instead, you can provide a set of default A\+CL rules with {\ttfamily Sabre\textbackslash{}D\+A\+V\+A\+CL\textbackslash{}Plugin\+::set\+Default\+Acl()}.
\item Introduced {\ttfamily Sabre\textbackslash{}D\+A\+V\+A\+CL\textbackslash{}A\+C\+L\+Trait} which contains a default implementation of {\ttfamily Sabre\textbackslash{}D\+AV\textbackslash{}I\+A\+CL} with some sane defaults. We\textquotesingle{}re using this trait all over the place now, reducing the amount of boilerplate.
\item Plugins can now control the \char`\"{}\+Supported Privilege Set\char`\"{}.
\item Added Sharing, I\+C\+S\+Export and V\+C\+F\+Export plugins to {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{groupwareserver_8php_source}{groupwareserver.\+php}}} example.
\item The {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}all} privilege is now no longer abstract, so it can be assigned directly. We\textquotesingle{}re using the {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}all} privilege now in a lot of cases where we before assigned both {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}read} and {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}write}.
\item Resources that are not collections no longer support the {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}bind} and {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}unbind} privileges.
\item Corrected the Cal\+D\+A\+V-\/scheduling related privileges.
\item Doing an {\ttfamily U\+N\+L\+O\+CK} no longer requires the {\ttfamily \{D\+AV\+:\}write-\/content} privilege.
\item Added a new {\ttfamily get\+Principal\+By\+Uri} plugin event. Allowing plugins to request quickly where a principal lives on a server.
\item Renamed {\ttfamily phpunit.\+xml} to {\ttfamily phpunit.\+xml.\+dist} to make local modifications easy.
\item Functionality from {\ttfamily I\+Shareable\+Calendar} is merged into {\ttfamily I\+Shared\+Calendar}.
\item \#751\+: Fixed X\+ML responses from failing {\ttfamily M\+K\+C\+OL} requests.
\item \#600\+: Support for {\ttfamily principal-\/match} A\+CL {\ttfamily R\+E\+P\+O\+RT}.
\item \#599\+: Support for {\ttfamily acl-\/principal-\/prop-\/set} A\+CL {\ttfamily R\+E\+P\+O\+RT}.
\item \#798\+: Added an index on {\ttfamily firstoccurence} field in My\+S\+QL Cal\+D\+AV backend. This should speed up common calendar-\/query requests.
\item \#759\+: D\+AV is now able to actually correctly resolve relative urls.
\item \#671\+: We are no longer checking the {\ttfamily read-\/free-\/busy} privilege on individual calendars during freebusy operations in the scheduling plugin. Instead, we check the {\ttfamily schedule-\/query-\/freebusy} privilege on the target users\textquotesingle{} inbox, which validates access for the entire account, per the spec.

\item BC Break\+: Property updating and fetching got refactored. Read the \href{http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/}{\tt migration document} for more information. This allows for creation of a generic property storage, and other property-\/related functionality that was not possible before.
\item BC Break\+: Removed {\ttfamily property\+Update}, {\ttfamily before\+Get\+Properties} and {\ttfamily after\+Get\+Properties} events.

\item Fixed\+: Issue \#428\+: Etag check with {\ttfamily If\+:} fails if the target is a collection.
\item Fixed\+: Issues \#430, \#431, \#433\+: Locks plugin didn\textquotesingle{}t not properly release filesystem based locks.

\item Removed\+: {\ttfamily Sabre\textbackslash{}D\+AV\textbackslash{}Server\+::\+N\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+$\ast$} constants.
\item Moved all precondition checking into a central place, instead of having to think about it on a per-\/method basis.

\item Fixed\+: \#175. Returning E\+Tag header upon a failed {\ttfamily If-\/\+Match} or {\ttfamily If-\/\+None-\/\+Match} check.
\item Removed\+: {\ttfamily lib/\+Sabre/autoload.\+php}. Use {\ttfamily vendor/autoload.\+php} instead.

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+9.\+0-\/alpha1 (2013-\/11-\/07) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 3.\+1.\+3, sabre/http 2.\+0.\+0alpha5, and sabre/event 1.\+0.\+0.
\item BC Break\+: The Card\+D\+AV and Cal\+D\+AV Backend\+Interface each have a new method\+: get\+Multiple\+Cards and get\+Multiple\+Calendar\+Objects. The Abstract and P\+DO backends have default implementations, but if you implement that interface directly, this method is now required.
\item BC Break\+: X\+ML property classes now receive an extra argument in their unserialize method (\$property\+Map). This allows for recursively parsing properties, if needed.
\item BC Break\+: Now using sabre/event for event emitting/subscription. For plugin authors this means Server\+::subscribe\+Event is now Server\+::on, and Server\+::broadcast\+Event is now Server\+::emit.
\item BC Break\+: Almost all core functionality moved into a Core\+Plugin.
\item BC Break\+: Most events triggered by the server got an overhaul.
\item Changed\+: Sabre now moved into a dedicated sabre/http package.
\item Added\+: Support for Web\+D\+A\+V-\/sync (rfc6578).
\item Added\+: Support for caldav-\/subscriptions, which is an easy way for caldav clients to manage a list of subscriptions on the server.
\item Added\+: Support for emitting and receiving j\+Cal instead of i\+Calendar for Cal\+D\+AV.
\item Added\+: Basic\+Callback authenticaton backend, for creating simple authentication systems without having to define any classes.
\item Added\+: A \$transaction\+Type property on the server class. This can be used for logging and performance measuring purposes.
\item Fixed\+: If event handlers modify the request body from a P\+UT request, an E\+Tag is no longer sent back.
\item Added\+: Sabre to optimize requests that retrieve information about lists of resources.
\item Added\+: Multi\+Get support to default Cal\+D\+AV and Card\+D\+AV backends, speeding up the multiget and sync reports quite a bit!
\item Added\+: I\+C\+S\+Export\+Plugin can now generate j\+Cal, filter on time-\/ranges and expand recurrences.
\item Fixed\+: Read-\/only access to calendars still allows the sharee to modify basic calendar properties, such as the displayname and color.
\item Changed\+: The default supported\+Privilege\+Set has changed. Most privileges are no longer marked as abstract.
\item Changed\+: More elegant A\+CL management for Calendar\+Object and Card nodes.
\item Added\+: Browser plugin now marks a carddav directory as type Directory, and a shared calendar as \textquotesingle{}Shared\textquotesingle{}.
\item Added\+: When debug\+Exceptions is turned on, all previous exceptions are also traversed.
\item Removed\+: Got rid of the Version classes for Cal\+D\+AV, Card\+D\+AV, H\+T\+TP, and D\+A\+V\+A\+CL. Now that there\textquotesingle{}s no separate packages anymore, this makes a bit more sense.
\item Added\+: Generalized the multistatus response parser a bit more, for better re-\/use.
\item Added\+: Sabre now has support for complex properties for P\+R\+O\+P\+P\+A\+T\+CH. (Issue \#299).
\item Added\+: Sabre has support for gzip and deflate encoding.
\item Added\+: Sabre now has support for sending objects as streams.
\item Added\+: Deserializer for \{D\+AV\+:\}current-\/user-\/privilege-\/set.
\item Added\+: Addressbooks or backends can now specify custom acl rules when creating cards.
\item Added\+: The ability for plugins to validate custom tokens in If\+: headers.
\item Changed\+: Completely refactored the Lock plugin to deal with the new If\+: header system.
\item Added\+: Checking preconditions for M\+O\+VE, C\+O\+PY, D\+E\+L\+E\+TE and P\+R\+O\+P\+P\+A\+T\+CH methods.
\item Added\+: has() method on D\+AV.
\item Added\+: If header now gets checked (with E\+Tag) all the time. Before the dealing with the If-\/header was a responsibility of the Locking plugin.
\item Fixed\+: Outbox access for delegates.
\item Added\+: Issue 333\+: It\textquotesingle{}s now possible to override the calendar-\/home in the Cal\+D\+AV plugin.
\item Added\+: A negotiate\+Content\+Type to H\+T\+TP. A convenience method.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 349\+: Denying copying or moving a resource into it\textquotesingle{}s own subtree.
\item Fixed\+: Sabre\+D\+AV catches every exception again.
\item Added\+: Issue \#358, adding a component=vevent parameter to the content-\/types for calendar objects, if the caldav backend provides this info.

\item BC Break\+: Changed a bunch of constructor signatures in the Cal\+D\+AV package, to reduce dependencies on the A\+CL package.
\item BC Break\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+Cal\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+I\+Shared\+Calendar now also has a get\+Shares method, so sharees can figure out who is also on a shared calendar.

\subsection*{1.\+7.\+2 (2012-\/11-\/08) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.\+0.\+5.
\item Added\+: A\+CL plugin advertises support for \textquotesingle{}calendarserver-\/principal-\/ property-\/search\textquotesingle{}.

\item Fixed\+: Made a bunch of properties protected, where they were private before.
\item Added\+: Some non-\/standard properties for sharing to improve compatibility.
\item Fixed\+: some bugfixes in postgres sql script.
\item Fixed\+: When requesting some properties using P\+R\+O\+P\+F\+I\+ND, they could show up as both \textquotesingle{}200 Ok\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}403 Forbidden\textquotesingle{}.
\item Fixed\+: calendar-\/proxy principals were not checked for deeper principal membership than 1 level.
\item Fixed\+: set\+Group\+Member\+Set argument now correctly receives relative principal urls, instead of the absolute ones.
\item Fixed\+: Server class will filter out any bonus properties if any extra were returned. This means the implementor of the I\+Property class can be a bit lazier when implementing. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_note}{Note}}\+: bug numbers after this line refer to Google Code tickets. We\textquotesingle{}re using github now.

\subsection*{1.\+7.\+1 (2012-\/10-\/07) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+7.\+0 (2012-\/10-\/06) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item BC Break\+: The calendarobjects database table has a bunch of new fields, and a migration script is required to ensure everything will keep working. Read the wiki for more details.
\item BC Break\+: The I\+Calendar interface now has a new method\+: calendar\+Query.
\item BC Break\+: In this version a number of classes have been deleted, that have been previously deprecated. Namely\+: -\/ Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Directory (now\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Collection) -\/ Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Simple\+Directory (now\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Simple\+Collection)
\item BC Break\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+Cal\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Schedule\+\_\+\+I\+Mip\+::send\+Message now has an extra argument. If you extended this class, you should fix this method. It\textquotesingle{}s only used for informational purposes.
\item BC Break\+: The D\+AV\+: namespace is no longer converted to urn\+:D\+AV. This was a workaround for a bug in older P\+HP versions (pre-\/5.\+3).
\item Removed\+: Sabre.\+includes.\+php was deprecated, and is now removed.
\item Removed\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+Cal\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server was deprecated, and is now removed. Please use Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server and check the examples in the examples/ directory.
\item Changed\+: The Sabre\+\_\+\+V\+Object library now spawned into it\textquotesingle{}s own project! The V\+Object library is still included in the Sabre\+D\+AV zip package.
\item Added\+: Experimental interfaces to allow implementation of caldav-\/sharing. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_note}{Note}} that no implementation is provided yet, just the api hooks.

\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_update}{Update}}\+: Caching results for principal lookups. This should cut down queries and performance for a number of heavy requests.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_update}{Update}}\+: Object\+Tree caches lookups much more aggresively, which will help especially speeding up a bunch of R\+E\+P\+O\+RT queries.
\item Added\+: Support for the schedule-\/calendar-\/transp property.
\item Fixed\+: Marking both the text/calendar and text/x-\/vcard as U\+T\+F-\/8 encoded.
\item Fixed\+: Workaround for the S\+O\+GO connector, as it doesn\textquotesingle{}t understand receiving \char`\"{}text/x-\/vcard; charset=utf-\/8\char`\"{} for a contenttype.
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Client now throws more specific exceptions in cases where we already has an exception class.
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Partial\+Update. This plugin allows you to use the P\+A\+T\+CH method to update parts of a file.
\item Added\+: Tons of timezone name mappings for Microsoft Exchange.
\item Added\+: Support for an \textquotesingle{}exception\textquotesingle{} event in the server class.

\item Fixed\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+X\+M\+L\+Util no longer returns empty \$dom-\/$>$child\+Nodes if there is whitespace in \$dom.
\item Fixed\+: Returning 409 Conflict instead of 500 when an attempt is made to create a file as a child of something that\textquotesingle{}s not a collection.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 237\+: xml-\/encoding values in Sabre\+D\+AV error responses.

\subsection*{1.\+6.\+7 (2013-\/03-\/01) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change\+: No longer advertising support for 4.\+0 vcards. i\+OS and OS X address book don\textquotesingle{}t handle this well, and just advertising 3.\+0 support seems like the most logical course of action.
\item Added\+: -\/$>$set\+Verify\+Peers to Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Client (greatly resisting against it, don\textquotesingle{}t use this..).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+6.\+6 (2013-\/01-\/19) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Fixed\+: Issue 235\+: E\+\_\+\+N\+O\+T\+I\+CE thrown when doing a propfind request with Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Client, and no valid properties are returned.
\item Fixed\+: Issue with filtering on alarms in tasks.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+6.\+4 (2012-\/08-\/02) }

\item Fixed\+: Correctly checking if recurring, all-\/day events with no dtstart fall in a timerange if the start of the time-\/range exceeds the start of the instance of an event, but not the end.
\item Fixed\+: All-\/day recurring events wouldn\textquotesingle{}t match if an occurence ended exactly on the start of a time-\/range.
\item Fixed\+: H\+T\+TP basic auth did not correctly deal with passwords containing colons on some servers.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 228\+: D\+T\+E\+ND is now non-\/inclusive for all-\/day events in the calendar-\/query R\+E\+P\+O\+RT and free-\/busy calculations.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+6.\+3 (2012-\/06-\/12) }

\item Added\+: It\textquotesingle{}s now possible to specify in Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Client which type of authentication is to be used.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 206\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Client P\+UT requests are fixed.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 205\+: Parsing an i\+Calendar 0-\/second date interval.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 112\+: Stronger validation of i\+Calendar objects. Now making sure every i\+Calendar object only contains 1 component, and disallowing vcards, forcing every component to have a U\+ID.
\item Fixed\+: Basic validation for vcards in the Card\+D\+AV plugin.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 213\+: Workaround for an Evolution bug, that prevented it from updating events.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 211\+: A time-\/limit query on a non-\/relative alarm trigger in a recurring event could result in an endless loop.
\item Fixed\+: All uri fields are now a maximum of 200 characters. The Bynari outlook plugin used much longer strings so this should improve compatibility.
\item Fixed\+: Added a workaround for a bug in K\+DE 4.\+8.\+2 contact syncing. See \href{https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300047}{\tt https\+://bugs.\+kde.\+org/show\+\_\+bug.\+cgi?id=300047}
\item Fixed\+: Issue 217\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Tree\+\_\+\+File\+System was pretty broken.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+6.\+2 (2012-\/04-\/16) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Fixed\+: D\+T\+S\+T\+A\+RT values would be incorrect when expanding events.
\item Fixed\+: D\+T\+S\+T\+A\+RT and D\+T\+E\+ND would be incorrect for expansion of W\+E\+E\+K\+LY B\+Y\+D\+AY recurrences.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 203\+: A problem with overridden events hitting the exact date and time of a subsequent event in the recurrence set.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: create\+File and put() can now return an E\+Tag.
\item Added\+: Sending back an E\+Tag on for operations on Card\+D\+AV backends. This should help with OS X 10.\+6 Addressbook compatibility.
\item Fixed\+: Fixed a bug where an infinite loop could occur in the recurrence iterator if the recurrence was Y\+E\+A\+R\+LY, with a B\+Y\+M\+O\+N\+TH rule, and either B\+Y\+D\+AY or B\+Y\+M\+O\+N\+T\+H\+D\+AY match the first day of the month.
\item Fixed\+: Events that are excluded using E\+X\+D\+A\+TE are still counted in the C\+O\+U\+NT= parameter in the R\+R\+U\+LE property.
\item Added\+: Support for time-\/range filters on V\+A\+L\+A\+RM components.
\item Fixed\+: Correctly filtering all-\/day events.
\item Fixed\+: Sending back correct mimetypes from the browser plugin (thanks JÃ¼rgen).
\item Fixed\+: Issue 195\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+Card\+D\+AV pear package had an incorrect dependency.
\item Fixed\+: Calendardata would be destroyed when performing a M\+O\+VE request.

\item Changed\+: before\+Create\+File event now passes data argument by reference.
\item Changed\+: The \textquotesingle{}property\+Map\textquotesingle{} property from Sabre\+\_\+\+V\+Object\+\_\+\+Reader, must now be specified in Sabre\+\_\+\+V\+Object\+\_\+\+Property\+::\$class\+Map.
\item Added\+: Ability for plugins to tell the A\+CL plugin which principal plugins are searchable.

\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+V\+Object\+\_\+\+Component\+::get\+Components() to return a list of only components and not properties.
\item Added\+: An includes.\+php file in every sub-\/package (Cal\+D\+AV, Card\+D\+AV, D\+AV, D\+A\+V\+A\+CL, H\+T\+TP, V\+Object) as an alternative to the autoloader. This often works much faster.

\item Added\+: M\+I\+M\+E-\/\+Directory grouping support in the V\+Object library. This is very useful for people attempting to parse vcards.

\item BC Break\+: lib/\+Sabre.\+autoload.\+php is now removed in favor of lib/\+Sabre/autoload.\+php.
\item Deprecated\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Directory is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Collection instead.

\item Changed\+: Browser plugin now uses P\+O\+ST variable \textquotesingle{}sabre\+Action\textquotesingle{} instead of \textquotesingle{}action\textquotesingle{} to reduce the chance of collisions.

\item Deprecated\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Locks\+\_\+\+Backend\+\_\+\+FS is now deprecated and will be removed in a later version. Use P\+DO or the new File class instead.
\item Deprecated\+: The Sabre\+\_\+\+Cal\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+I\+Calendar\+Util class is now marked deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. Please use Sabre\+\_\+\+V\+Object instead.
\item Removed\+: All principal-\/related functionality has been removed from the Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Auth\+\_\+\+Plugin, and moved to the Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+A\+C\+L\+\_\+\+Plugin.
\item Added\+: V\+Object library, for easy vcard/icalendar parsing using a natural interface.
\item Added\+: Ability to automatically generate full .ics feeds off calendars. To use\+: Add the Sabre\+\_\+\+Cal\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+I\+C\+S\+Export\+Plugin, and add ?export to your calendar url.
\item Added\+: Plugins can now specify a pluginname, for easy access using Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server\+::get\+Plugin().
\item Added\+: before\+Get\+Properties event.
\item Added\+: update\+Properties event.
\item Added\+: Principal listings and calendar-\/access can now be done privately, disallowing users from accessing or modifying other users\textquotesingle{} data.
\item Added\+: You can now pass arrays to the Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server constructor. If it\textquotesingle{}s an array with node-\/objects, a Root collection will automatically be created, and the nodes are used as top-\/level children.
\item Added\+: The principal base uri is now customizable. It used to be hardcoded to \textquotesingle{}principals/\mbox{[}user\mbox{]}\textquotesingle{}.
\item Added\+: get\+Supported\+Report\+Set method in Server\+Plugin class. This allows you to easily specify which reports you\textquotesingle{}re implementing.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: child\+Exists method to Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+I\+Collection. This is an api break, so if you implement Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+I\+Collection directly, add the method.
\item Changed\+: Almost all H\+T\+TP method implementations now take a uri argument, including events. This allows for internal rerouting of certain calls. If you have custom plugins, make sure they use this argument. If they don\textquotesingle{}t, they will likely still work, but it might get in the way of future changes.
\item Changed\+: All get\+E\+Tag methods M\+U\+ST now surround the etag with double-\/quotes. This was a mistake made in all previous Sabre\+D\+AV versions. If you don\textquotesingle{}t do this, any If-\/\+Match, If-\/\+None-\/\+Match and If\+: headers using Etags will work incorrectly. (Issue 85).
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Auth\+\_\+\+Backend\+\_\+\+Abstract\+Basic class, which can be used to easily implement basic authentication.

\item Changed\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+H\+T\+T\+P\+\_\+\+Response now returns false if headers are already sent and header-\/methods are called.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 19\+: H\+E\+AD requests on Collections
\item Fixed\+: Issue 21\+: Typo in Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Property\+\_\+\+Response
\item Fixed\+: Issue 18\+: Doesn\textquotesingle{}t work with Evolution Contacts

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+7 (2010-\/02-\/24) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: Issue 19 regression for MS Office

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: Issue 19\+: H\+E\+AD requests on Collections
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+5 (2010-\/01-\/22) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: Fatal error when a malformed url was used for unlocking, in conjuction with Sabre.\+autoload.\+php due to a incorrect filename.

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+4 (2010-\/01-\/11) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: needed 2 different releases. One for googlecode and one for pearfarm. This is to retain the old method to install Sabre\+D\+AV until pearfarm becomes the standard installation method.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+3 (2010-\/01-\/11) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: R\+F\+C4709 support (davmount)
\item Added\+: 6 unittests
\item Added\+: naturalselection. A tool to keep cache directories below a specified theshold.
\item Changed\+: Now using pearfarm.\+org channel server.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+1 (2009-\/12-\/22) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: Issue 15\+: typos in examples
\item Fixed\+: Minor pear installation issues
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{1.\+0.\+0 (2009-\/11-\/02) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Simple\+Directory class. This class allows creating static directory structures with ease.
\item Changed\+: Custom complex properties and exceptions now get an instance of Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server as their first argument in serialize()
\item Changed\+: Href complex property now prepends server\textquotesingle{}s base\+Uri
\item Changed\+: delete before an overwriting copy/move is now handles by server class instead of tree classes
\item Changed\+: events must now explicitly return false to stop execution. Before, execution would be stopped by anything loosely evaluating to false.
\item Changed\+: the get\+Properties\+For\+Path method now takes a different set of arguments, and returns a different response. This allows plugin developers to return statuses for properties other than 200 and 404. The hrefs are now also always calculated relative to the base\+Uri, and not the uri of the request.
\item Changed\+: generate\+Prop\+Find\+Response is renamed to generate\+Multi\+Status, and now takes a list of properties similar to the response of get\+Properties\+For\+Path. This was also needed to improve flexibility for plugin development.
\item Changed\+: Auth plugins are no longer included. They were not yet stable quality, so they will probably be reintroduced in a later version.
\item Changed\+: P\+R\+O\+P\+P\+A\+T\+CH also used generate\+Multi\+Status now.
\item Removed\+: unknown\+Properties event. This is replaced by the after\+Get\+Properties event, which should provide more flexibility.
\item Fixed\+: Only calling get\+Size() on I\+File instances in http\+Head()
\item Added\+: before\+Bind event. This is invoked upon file or directory creation
\item Added\+: before\+Write\+Content event, this is invoked by P\+UT and L\+O\+CK on an existing resource.
\item Added\+: before\+Unbind event. This is invoked right before deletion of any resource.
\item Added\+: after\+Get\+Properties event. This event can be used to make modifications to property responses.
\item Added\+: before\+Lock and before\+Unlock events.
\item Added\+: after\+Bind event.
\item Fixed\+: Copy and Move could fail in the root directory. This is now fixed.
\item Added\+: Plugins can now be retrieved by their classname. This is useful for inter-\/plugin communication.
\item Added\+: The Auth backend can now return usernames and user-\/id\textquotesingle{}s.
\item Added\+: The Auth backend got a get\+Users method
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+F\+S\+Ext\+\_\+\+Directory now returns quota info
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+12.\+1-\/beta (2009-\/09-\/11) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: U\+N\+L\+O\+CK bug. Unlock didn\textquotesingle{}t work at all
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+12-\/beta (2009-\/09-\/10) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated\+: Browser plugin now shows multiple \{D\+AV\+:\}resourcetype values if available.
\item Added\+: Experimental P\+DO backend for Locks Manager
\item Fixed\+: Sending Content-\/\+Length\+: 0 for every empty response. This improves N\+Ginx compatibility.
\item Fixed\+: Last modification time is reported in U\+TC timezone. This improves Finder compatibility.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+11-\/beta (2009-\/08-\/11) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated\+: Now in Beta
\item Updated\+: Pear package no longer includes docs/ directory. These just contained rfc\textquotesingle{}s, which are publicly available. This reduces the package from $\sim$800k to $\sim$60k
\item Added\+: generate\+Propfind\+Response now takes a base\+Uri argument
\item Added\+: Resource\+Type property can now contain multiple resourcetypes.
\item Fixed\+: Issue 13.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+10-\/alpha (2009-\/08-\/03) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Plugin to automatically map G\+ET requests to non-\/files to P\+R\+O\+P\+F\+I\+ND (Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Browser\+\_\+\+Map\+Get\+To\+Prop\+Find). This should allow easier debugging of complicated Web\+D\+AV setups.
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Property\+\_\+\+Href class. For future use.
\item Added\+: Ability to choose to use auth-\/int, auth or both for H\+T\+TP Digest authentication. (Issue 11)
\item Changed\+: Made more methods in Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server public.
\item Fixed\+: Temporary\+File\+Filter plugin now intercepts H\+T\+TP L\+O\+CK requests to non-\/existent files. (Issue 12)
\item Added\+: Central list of defined xml namespace prefixes. This can reduce Bandwidth and legibility for xml bodies with user-\/defined namespaces.
\item Added\+: now a P\+E\+A\+R-\/compatible package again, thanks to Michael Gauthier
\item Changed\+: moved default copy and move logic from Object\+Tree to Tree class
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+9a-\/alpha (2009-\/07-\/21) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: Broken release
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+9-\/alpha (2009-\/07-\/21) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed\+: Major refactoring, removed most of the logic from the Tree objects. The Server class now directly works with the I\+Node, I\+File and I\+Directory objects. If you created your own Tree objects, this will most likely break in this release.
\item Changed\+: Moved all the Locking logic from the Tree and Server classes into a separate plugin.
\item Changed\+: Temporary\+File\+Filter is now a plugin.
\item Added\+: Comes with an autoloader script. This can be used instead of the includer script, and is preferred by some people.
\item Added\+: A\+WS Authentication class.
\item Added\+: simpleserversetup.\+py script. This will quickly get a fileserver up and running.
\item Added\+: When subscribing to events, it is now possible to supply a priority. This is for example needed to ensure that the Authentication Plugin is used before any other Plugin.
\item Added\+: 22 new tests.
\item Added\+: Users-\/manager plugin for .htdigest files. Experimental and subject to change.
\item Added\+: R\+FC 2324 H\+T\+TP 418 status code
\item Fixed\+: Exclusive locks could in some cases be picked up as shared locks
\item Fixed\+: Digest auth for non-\/apache servers had a bug (still not actually tested this well).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+8-\/alpha (2009-\/05-\/30) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed\+: Renamed all exceptions! This is a compatibility break. Every Exception now follows Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Exception\+\_\+\+File\+Not\+Found convention instead of Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+File\+Not\+Found\+Exception.
\item Added\+: Browser plugin now allows uploading and creating directories straight from the browser.
\item Added\+: 12 more unittests
\item Fixed\+: Locking bug, which became prevalent on Windows Vista.
\item Fixed\+: Netdrive support
\item Fixed\+: Temporary\+File\+Filter filtered out too many files. Fixed some of the regexes.
\item Fixed\+: Added R\+E\+A\+D\+ME and Change\+Log to package
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+7-\/alpha (2009-\/03-\/29) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: System to return complex properties from P\+R\+O\+P\+F\+I\+ND.
\item Added\+: support for \{D\+AV\+:\}supportedlock.
\item Added\+: support for \{D\+AV\+:\}lockdiscovery.
\item Added\+: 6 new tests.
\item Added\+: New plugin system.
\item Added\+: Simple H\+T\+ML directory plugin, for browser access.
\item Added\+: Server class now sends back standard pre-\/condition error xml bodies. This was new since R\+F\+C4918.
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Tree\+\_\+\+Aggregate, which can \textquotesingle{}host\textquotesingle{} multiple Tree objects into one.
\item Added\+: simple basis for H\+T\+TP R\+E\+P\+O\+RT method. This method is not used yet, but can be used by plugins to add reports.
\item Changed\+: -\/$>$get\+Size is only called for files, no longer for collections. r303
\item Changed\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Filter\+Tree is now Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Tree\+\_\+\+Filter
\item Changed\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Temporary\+File\+Filter is now called Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Tree\+\_\+\+Temporary\+File\+Filter.
\item Changed\+: removed functions (get(/set)H\+T\+T\+P\+Request(/\+Response)) from Server class, and using a public property instead.
\item Fixed\+: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn\textquotesingle{}t show up in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless. (r255)
\item Fixed\+: auth-\/int is now properly supported within H\+T\+TP Digest.
\item Fixed\+: Using application/xml for a mimetype vs. text/xml as per R\+F\+C4918 sec 8.\+2.
\item Fixed\+: Temporary\+File\+Filter now lets through G\+ET\textquotesingle{}s if they actually exist on the backend. (r274)
\item Fixed\+: Some methods didn\textquotesingle{}t get passed through in the Filter\+Tree (r283).
\item Fixed\+: Lock\+Manager is now slightly more complex, Tree classes slightly less. (r287)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+6-\/alpha (2009-\/02-\/16) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings. This means it won\textquotesingle{}t require to hold entire files in memory, which can be an issue if you\textquotesingle{}re dealing with big files. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_note}{Note}} that this breaks compatibility for put() and create\+File methods.
\item Added\+: H\+T\+TP Digest Authentication helper class.
\item Added\+: Support for H\+T\+TP Range header
\item Added\+: Support for E\+Tags within If\+: headers
\item Added\+: The A\+PI can now return E\+Tags and override the default Content-\/\+Type
\item Added\+: starting with basic framework for unittesting, using P\+H\+P\+Unit.
\item Added\+: 49 unittests.
\item Added\+: Abstraction for the H\+T\+TP request.
\item Updated\+: Using Clark Notation for tags in properties. This means tags are serialized as \{namespace\}tag\+Name instead of namespace\+::tag\+Name
\item Fixed\+: H\+T\+T\+P\+\_\+\+Basic\+Auth class now works as expected.
\item Fixed\+: D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server uses / for a default base\+Url.
\item Fixed\+: Last modification date is no longer ignored in P\+R\+O\+P\+F\+I\+ND.
\item Fixed\+: P\+R\+O\+P\+F\+I\+ND now sends back information about the request\+Uri even when \char`\"{}\+Depth\+: 1\char`\"{} is specified.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{0.\+5-\/alpha (2009-\/01-\/14) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to P\+HP file streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a Web\+D\+AV to F\+TP proxy.
\item Added\+: H\+T\+TP Basic Authentication helper class.
\item Added\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+H\+T\+T\+P\+\_\+\+Response class. This centralizes H\+T\+TP operations and will be a start towards the creating of a testing framework.
\item Updated\+: Backwards compatibility break\+: all require\+\_\+once() statements are removed from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of classes, or just including lib/\+Sabre.\+includes.\+php. This fix was made to allow easier integration into applications not using this standard inclusion model.
\item Updated\+: Better in-\/file documentation.
\item Updated\+: Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Tree can now work with Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Lock\+Manager.
\item Updated\+: Fixes a shared-\/lock bug.
\item Updated\+: Removed ?$>$ from the bottom of each php file.
\item Updated\+: Split up some operations from Sabre\+\_\+\+D\+A\+V\+\_\+\+Server to Sabre\+\_\+\+H\+T\+T\+P\+\_\+\+Response.
\item Fixed\+: examples are now actually included in the pear package.
