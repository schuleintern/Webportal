\item Now throwing {\ttfamily Invalid\+Uri\+Exception} if a uri passed to the {\ttfamily parse} function is invalid or could not be parsed.
\item \#11\+: Fix support for U\+R\+Is that start with a triple slash. P\+HP\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily parse\+\_\+uri()} doesn\textquotesingle{}t support them, so we now have a pure-\/php fallback in case it fails.
\item \#9\+: Fix support for relative U\+RI\textquotesingle{}s that have a non-\/uri encoded colon {\ttfamily \+:} in them.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \#6\+: P\+HP\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily parse\+\_\+url()} corrupts strings if they contain certain non ascii-\/characters such as Chinese or Hebrew. sabre/uri\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily parse()} function now percent-\/encodes these characters beforehand.
