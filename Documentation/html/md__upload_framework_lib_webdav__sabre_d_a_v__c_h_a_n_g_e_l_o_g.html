<ul>
<li>#943: Fix CardDAV XML reporting bug, which was affecting several CardDAV clients. Bug was introduced in 3.2.1.</li>

</ul>
<h2>3.2.0 (2016-06-27) </h2>
<ul>
<li>The default ACL rules allow an unauthenticated user to read information about nodes that don't have their own ACL defined. This was a security problem.</li>
<li>The zip release ships with <a href="http://sabre.io/vobject/">sabre/vobject 4.1.0</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/http/">sabre/http 4.2.1</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/event/">sabre/event 3.0.0</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/uri/">sabre/uri 1.1.0</a> and <a href="http://sabre.io/xml/">sabre/xml 1.4.2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.2.0-beta1 (2016-05-20) </h2>
<ul>
<li>#833: Calendars throw exceptions when the sharing plugin is not enabled.</li>
<li>#834: Return vCards exactly as they were stored if we don't need to convert in between versions.</li>
<li>The zip release ships with <a href="http://sabre.io/vobject/">sabre/vobject 4.1.0</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/http/">sabre/http 4.2.1</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/event/">sabre/event 3.0.0</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/uri/">sabre/uri 1.1.0</a> and <a href="http://sabre.io/xml/">sabre/xml 1.4.1</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.2.0-alpha1 (2016-05-09) </h2>
<ul>
<li>Database changes for CalDAV. If you are using the CalDAV PDO backends, you must migrate. Run <code>./bin/migrateto32.php</code> for more info.</li>
<li>Support for WebDAV Resource Sharing, an upcoming standard.</li>
<li>Added support for sharing in the CalDAV PDO backend! Users can now invite others to their calendar and give them read/read-write access!</li>
<li>#397: Support for PSR-3. You can now log exceptions with your favourite psr3-compatible logging tool.</li>
<li>#825: Actual proper, tested support for PostgreSQL. We require version 9.5.</li>
<li>Removed database migration script for sabre/dav 1.7. To update from that version you now first need to update to sabre/dav 3.1.</li>
<li>Removed deprecated function: <code>Sabre\DAV\Auth\Plugin::getCurrentUser()</code>.</li>
<li>#774: Fixes for getting free disk space on Windows.</li>
<li>#803: Major changes in the sharing API. If you were using an old sabre/dav sharing api, head to the website for more detailed migration notes.</li>
<li>#657: Support for optional auth using <code>{DAV:}unauthorized</code> and <code>{DAV:}all</code> privileges. This allows you to assign a privilege to a resource, allowing non-authenticated users to access it. For instance, this could allow you to create a public read-only collection.</li>
<li>#812 #814: ICS/VCF exporter now includes a more useful filename in its <code>Content-Disposition</code> header. ().</li>
<li>#801: BC break: If you were using the <code>Href</code> object before, it's behavior now changed a bit, and <code>LocalHref</code> was added to replace the old, default behavior of <code>Href</code>. See the migration doc for more info.</li>
<li>Removed <code>Sabre\DAVACL\Plugin::$allowAccessToNodesWithoutACL</code> setting. Instead, you can provide a set of default ACL rules with <code>Sabre\DAVACL\Plugin::setDefaultAcl()</code>.</li>
<li>Introduced <code>Sabre\DAVACL\ACLTrait</code> which contains a default implementation of <code>Sabre\DAV\IACL</code> with some sane defaults. We're using this trait all over the place now, reducing the amount of boilerplate.</li>
<li>Plugins can now control the "Supported Privilege Set".</li>
<li>Added Sharing, ICSExport and VCFExport plugins to <code><a class="el" href="groupwareserver_8php_source.html">groupwareserver.php</a></code> example.</li>
<li>The <code>{DAV:}all</code> privilege is now no longer abstract, so it can be assigned directly. We're using the <code>{DAV:}all</code> privilege now in a lot of cases where we before assigned both <code>{DAV:}read</code> and <code>{DAV:}write</code>.</li>
<li>Resources that are not collections no longer support the <code>{DAV:}bind</code> and <code>{DAV:}unbind</code> privileges.</li>
<li>Corrected the CalDAV-scheduling related privileges.</li>
<li>Doing an <code>UNLOCK</code> no longer requires the <code>{DAV:}write-content</code> privilege.</li>
<li>Added a new <code>getPrincipalByUri</code> plugin event. Allowing plugins to request quickly where a principal lives on a server.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>phpunit.xml</code> to <code>phpunit.xml.dist</code> to make local modifications easy.</li>
<li>Functionality from <code>IShareableCalendar</code> is merged into <code>ISharedCalendar</code>.</li>
<li>#751: Fixed XML responses from failing <code>MKCOL</code> requests.</li>
<li>#600: Support for <code>principal-match</code> ACL <code>REPORT</code>.</li>
<li>#599: Support for <code>acl-principal-prop-set</code> ACL <code>REPORT</code>.</li>
<li>#798: Added an index on <code>firstoccurence</code> field in MySQL CalDAV backend. This should speed up common calendar-query requests.</li>
<li>#759: DAV is now able to actually correctly resolve relative urls.</li>
<li>#671: We are no longer checking the <code>read-free-busy</code> privilege on individual calendars during freebusy operations in the scheduling plugin. Instead, we check the <code>schedule-query-freebusy</code> privilege on the target users' inbox, which validates access for the entire account, per the spec.</li>
<li>The zip release ships with <a href="http://sabre.io/vobject/">sabre/vobject 4.1.0</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/http/">sabre/http 4.2.1</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/event/">sabre/event 3.0.0</a>, <a href="http://sabre.io/uri/">sabre/uri 1.1.0</a> and <a href="http://sabre.io/xml/">sabre/xml 1.4.1</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.1.5 (????-??-??) </h2>

<li>Fixed: Creating a new calendar on some MySQL configurations caused an error.</li>

</ul>
<h2>3.1.4 (2016-05-28) </h2>

<li>Added: When debugExceptions is turned on, all previous exceptions are also traversed.</li>
<li>Removed: Got rid of the Version classes for CalDAV, CardDAV, HTTP, and DAVACL. Now that there's no separate packages anymore, this makes a bit more sense.</li>
<li>Added: Generalized the multistatus response parser a bit more, for better re-use.</li>

<li>Added: Issue 333: It's now possible to override the calendar-home in the CalDAV plugin.</li>
<li>Added: A negotiateContentType to HTTP. A convenience method.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue 349: Denying copying or moving a resource into it's own subtree.</li>
<li>Fixed: SabreDAV catches every exception again.</li>
<li>Added: Issue #358, adding a component=vevent parameter to the content-types for calendar objects, if the caldav backend provides this info.</li>

<li>Fixed: Improved unittests and build system</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.4 (2010-01-11) </h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: needed 2 different releases. One for googlecode and one for pearfarm. This is to retain the old method to install SabreDAV until pearfarm becomes the standard installation method.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added: RFC4709 support (davmount)</li>

<li>Changed: events must now explicitly return false to stop execution. Before, execution would be stopped by anything loosely evaluating to false.</li>
<li>Changed: the getPropertiesForPath method now takes a different set of arguments, and returns a different response. This allows plugin developers to return statuses for properties other than 200 and 404. The hrefs are now also always calculated relative to the baseUri, and not the uri of the request.</li>
<li>Changed: generatePropFindResponse is renamed to generateMultiStatus, and now takes a list of properties similar to the response of getPropertiesForPath. This was also needed to improve flexibility for plugin development.</li>
<li>Changed: Auth plugins are no longer included. They were not yet stable quality, so they will probably be reintroduced in a later version.</li>
<li>Changed: PROPPATCH also used generateMultiStatus now.</li>
<li>Removed: unknownProperties event. This is replaced by the afterGetProperties event, which should provide more flexibility.</li>
<li>Fixed: Only calling getSize() on IFile instances in httpHead()</li>

<li>Added: afterGetProperties event. This event can be used to make modifications to property responses.</li>
<li>Added: beforeLock and beforeUnlock events.</li>

<ul>
<li>Updated: Browser plugin now shows multiple {DAV:}resourcetype values if available.</li>
<li>Added: Experimental PDO backend for Locks Manager</li>
<li>Fixed: Sending Content-Length: 0 for every empty response. This improves NGinx compatibility.</li>

</ul>
<h2>0.11-beta (2009-08-11) </h2>
<ul>

<li>Added: ResourceType property can now contain multiple resourcetypes.</li>
<li>Fixed: Issue 13.</li>

<li>Added: Sabre_DAV_Property_Href class. For future use.</li>
<li>Added: Ability to choose to use auth-int, auth or both for HTTP Digest authentication. (Issue 11)</li>
<li>Changed: Made more methods in Sabre_DAV_Server public.</li>
<li>Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter plugin now intercepts HTTP LOCK requests to non-existent files. (Issue 12)</li>
<li>Added: Central list of defined xml namespace prefixes. This can reduce Bandwidth and legibility for xml bodies with user-defined namespaces.</li>
<li>Added: now a PEAR-compatible package again, thanks to Michael Gauthier</li>
<li>Changed: moved default copy and move logic from ObjectTree to Tree class</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed: Broken release</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9-alpha (2009-07-21) </h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed: Major refactoring, removed most of the logic from the Tree objects. The Server class now directly works with the INode, IFile and IDirectory objects. If you created your own Tree objects, this will most likely break in this release.</li>
<li>Changed: Moved all the Locking logic from the Tree and Server classes into a separate plugin.</li>
<li>Changed: TemporaryFileFilter is now a plugin.</li>
<li>Added: Comes with an autoloader script. This can be used instead of the includer script, and is preferred by some people.</li>
<li>Added: AWS Authentication class.</li>
<li>Added: simpleserversetup.py script. This will quickly get a fileserver up and running.</li>
<li>Added: When subscribing to events, it is now possible to supply a priority. This is for example needed to ensure that the Authentication Plugin is used before any other Plugin.</li>
<li>Added: 22 new tests.</li>
<li>Added: Users-manager plugin for .htdigest files. Experimental and subject to change.</li>
<li>Added: RFC 2324 HTTP 418 status code</li>
<li>Fixed: Exclusive locks could in some cases be picked up as shared locks</li>
<li>Fixed: Digest auth for non-apache servers had a bug (still not actually tested this well).</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.8-alpha (2009-05-30) </h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed: Renamed all exceptions! This is a compatibility break. Every Exception now follows Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound convention instead of Sabre_DAV_FileNotFoundException.</li>

<li>Added: 12 more unittests</li>
<li>Fixed: Locking bug, which became prevalent on Windows Vista.</li>

<li>Added: simple basis for HTTP REPORT method. This method is not used yet, but can be used by plugins to add reports.</li>
<li>Changed: -&gt;getSize is only called for files, no longer for collections. r303</li>
<li>Changed: Sabre_DAV_FilterTree is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_Filter</li>

<li>Fixed: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn't show up in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless. (r255)</li>
<li>Fixed: auth-int is now properly supported within HTTP Digest.</li>
<li>Fixed: Using application/xml for a mimetype vs. text/xml as per RFC4918 sec 8.2.</li>
<li>Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter now lets through GET's if they actually exist on the backend. (r274)</li>
<li>Fixed: Some methods didn't get passed through in the FilterTree (r283).</li>
<li>Fixed: LockManager is now slightly more complex, Tree classes slightly less. (r287)</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.6-alpha (2009-02-16) </h2>
<ul>
<li>Added: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings. This means it won't require to hold entire files in memory, which can be an issue if you're dealing with big files. <a class="el" href="class_note.html">Note</a> that this breaks compatibility for put() and createFile methods.</li>
<li>Added: HTTP Digest Authentication helper class.</li>
<li>Added: Support for HTTP Range header</li>

<li>Fixed: DAV_Server uses / for a default baseUrl.</li>
<li>Fixed: Last modification date is no longer ignored in PROPFIND.</li>

</ul>
<h2>0.5-alpha (2009-01-14) </h2>
<ul>
<li>Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP file streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a WebDAV to FTP proxy.</li>
<li>Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.</li>
<li>Added: Sabre_HTTP_Response class. This centralizes HTTP operations and will be a start towards the creating of a testing framework.</li>
<li>Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements are removed from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made to allow easier integration into applications not using this standard inclusion model.</li>
<li>Updated: Better in-file documentation.</li>
<li>Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.</li>
<li>Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.</li>
